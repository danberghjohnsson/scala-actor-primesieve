This project aims to be a working example of how to setup a Scala project with Maven, IDEA and JUnit tests.

h1. How to setup

This example is tested using IDEA 9.0.3, Scala 2.8.0 and Maven 2.2.0, but latest versions of everything is probably fine.

* If you haven't done so already, "download and install IDEA":http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/
* If you haven't done so already, install the Scala plugin for IDEA. Settings -> Plugins -> Available -> Search for Scala -> Right-click "Scala" -> Download and install
* If you haven't done so already, "download and install Git":http://git-scm.com/download. If you're on Windows, the msysGit distribution is recommended
* If you haven't done so already, "download and install Maven":http://maven.apache.org/download.html
* Clone this repository by firing up a command line window, navigating to the directory you would like to have the source code and running the command @git clone git://github.com/karianne/mvn-minimal-example.git@
* Open IDEA by opening the project's POM file in IDEA
